###Activity 2
1) A deck is a class which contains cards in a specific order  
2) 6 cards  
3) To play the game "21" the following is required:  
```java
ranks = {"2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "jack", "queen", "king", "ace"};
suits = {"spades", "hearts", "diamonds", "clubs"};
pointValues = { 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 11 };
Deck d = new Deck(ranks, suits, pointValues);
```
4) The order of elements in *rank* and *pointValues* matter in that they must be of the same arbitrary order as eachother. The order of elements in *suits* do not matter.
